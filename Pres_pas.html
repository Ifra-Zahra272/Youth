    <h1>Introduction</h1>
Present youth are often characterized by their access to technology, a focus on personal achievement, and a more open approach to diverse perspectives, including those related to their own identity and social issues. Past youth, while still individuals navigating their own transitions, may have been more constrained by societal expectations, less exposed to global information, and perhaps less focused on individual identity politics.<br>
